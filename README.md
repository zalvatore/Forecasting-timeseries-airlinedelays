Flight delays can be problematic to both airlines and customers since they impact customer satisfaction and airline costs. Increased transparency in air travel timeliness will reduce dissatisfaction when expected delays occur. Thus, this study aims at taking a global, time-series based approach to create the most accurate model for predicting flight delays to ensure the American people have efficient and equitable access to transportation. The time-forecast models that were tested are na√Øve forecast, regression model, exponential smoothing model, ARIMA model, and neural network. RMSE was chosen to be the primary evaluation metric of this research. After comparison, the improved ARIMA model which took into consideration the influence of COVID-19 pandemic is found to outperform all the other models.
